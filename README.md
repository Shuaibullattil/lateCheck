 🕒 LateCheck – Smart Hostel Late Entry Management System

LateCheck is a web-based application designed to automate and streamline the process of managing late entries in college hostels. The platform replaces traditional manual logbooks with a secure, scalable, and efficient digital solution, enabling better communication and smarter administration between students and wardens.

**Key Features:**
✅ QR Code-based late entry logging
💬 One-on-one chat between students and wardens
🔔 Centralized notification center for announcements
📊 AI-powered analysis of late entry patterns
🛂 Role-based access (student/warden)
🔒 Secure login and user verification system

**Tech Stack:**
Frontend – Next.js | Backend – FastAPI | Database – MongoDB Atlas | Auth – JWT | AI – OpenAI API

**AI Behavior Analysis:**
Wardens can manually trigger analysis on student late entry data using OpenAI’s API to detect repeat offenders, identify behavioral patterns, and generate actionable insights. This helps improve discipline, transparency, and decision-making in hostel administration.
